# Links to UCI Rules / Links zu Regeln der UCI
The UIC typically publishes in English language. If you are interested in information in German language, Swiss Cycling usually is a good bet.

Die UCI publiziert in der Regel in Englisch. Deutsche Übersetzungen werden oft von Swiss Cycling zur Verfügung gestellt. Bindend sind die Informationen in den UCI Dokumenten.

### UCI home page

-- All Rules
This page is the location from which you can access all the rules in place:

-- Equiment rules 
This page refers to a table with all technical rules. The UCI has recently changed the structure of their web page, so links are a bit prone to instability. If the links are broken, please notify me. The structure of the page is at least confusing for me. Try the search function.

For bikes and setup this is what is more relevant.

-- Clarification of Technical rules 
Here you can find the information on how to interpret the UCI rules. The pdf document is typically more useful than the actual regulation. You can use it as guideline. The rules are however binding, not this illustration of the rules.

-- Measurement jig for TT bikes 
Easy to build. I did one from aluminum profiles. A couple of hours of work but fun and then it is easier to actually measure the bike setup.

-- The actual rules for the bikes are here. If you want to find them, you need to search for regulations.
