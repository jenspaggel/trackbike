Clinchers are faster for time trial events. This is a fact. If you are purchasing wheels for timed events, go for clinchers. 

For mass start events more and more riders use clinchers. IMHO, please don't do it. Tires sometimes explode upon wheel contact. With clinchers you will lose control. Period. You will. I do not care so much about you. I care about the other riders that will go down with you. As simple as that. Even with a flat tubular you and clear the bunch and stop safely. Has been done before. 

If you are a sprinter, you very likely will insist on having glued tires. The force transmission through the tires is spectacular. Again, if you are a sprinter, there are not many people around you. Sometimes there are incidents when a tire separates from an wheel. This does not only happen to male super sprinters, female super sprinter can do the same thing. In Keirin, there are uo to 6 other atheltes around you. Please play it safe. 

Why to clincher tubes explode on the track, occasionally? If you go fast and change the lines fast, the tire works a lot and gets warm and warms the rim. You can do that while going really slow. If you go slow in the banking, there is a lot of deformation in the tire. It tries to roll off the rim. Warm rim and slow riding shifts the rim tape on the rim. Spoke holes get exposed, tube goes into the spoke hole. This is what the tube generally does not survive long. If a clincher explodes underneath you on a track. I bet it will have a small semicicular hole on the inside. 

Countermeasures
- ride tubulars
- ride sticky rim tape
- ride rims without spoke holes
- tubeless on the track? Well, that gets messy when the tires goes off and you will need to do a lot of cleaning.
