Some answers to questions ...

Just in case, you did not ask, I tell you anyways. I am at tracks here and there. The more time I spend there, the more things I see and sometimes I look things up in the rule books. 

Sometimes I receive questions from parents. Good ones... So I collect information and distribute. My favorite quote is: "The parents are responsible for the UCI compliance of the bikes, when the kids travel to championships." What if the parents are not former competitive cyclists? Doomed. Here you may find help.
