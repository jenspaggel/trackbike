## Why are bike computers at handle bars not allowed in race (and not smart in training)? 

Why not in the races? There are rules against it. See below.

Why not in training? They are distracting the riders. If the track is yours and you are alone. Go for it. If you are sharing the track with other riders -- take care of their health and security was well as yours. Track riding is about focus. Focus on the bike, not the computer. 

## The rules of the game (as mof Summer 2021)

# UCI Regulations part 3 track racing:

3.2.005 Riders may carry no object on them or on their bicycles that could drop onto the track. They may not bear or use on the track any music player or radio communication system.
In addition, any electronic device with display (for instance speedometer or powermeter) must be hidden to that it cannot be read by the riders.

—————————-

In consequence: use you powermeter in the race, but keep the computer at the saddle or the seat post. You could have it at the bars, but it needs to be covered that you cannot read the numbers. Trust me, I will ceck before I start the race. 

----------

Telemetrics is not allowed as well, just in case you were just thingking about it. 

UCI cycling regulations part 1:

# §4 Onboard technology

1.3.006 Onboard technology devices, which capture or transmit data, may be fitted on bicycles bis or worn by riders subject to being authorised under the present article, without prejudice to other provisions of the UCI Regulations. The present article concerns any device which captures or transmits data as described below, including but not limited to sensors
(worn or ingested), transponders, rider information systems, telemetry devices.

1. Devices which capture or transmit the following types of data are authorised:
- Positioning: information related to the location of the rider or the bicycle;
- Image: still or moving images or footage captured from the bicycle (such
devices may only be fitted on the bicycle unless specific regulations of a given discipline authorise devices being worn by riders);
E0221 GENERAL ORGANISATION OF CYCLING AS A SPORT 58

§ 1 1.3.007
- Mechanical: information captured from the bicycle or any of its components, including but not limited to power, speed, cadence, accelerometer, gyroscope, gearing, tyre pressure.
2. Devices which capture or transmit the following physiological data are authorised: heartrate, body temperature, sweat rate. The authorisation is, however, limited to transmission protocols which enable only the rider concerned to view the data during a competition.
3. Devices which capture other physiological data, including any metabolic values such as but not limited to glucose or lactate are not authorised in competition.
The authorised capturing and transmitting of data as provided under this article shall not enable a rider to view data of another rider. Likewise, teams shall only access data of their riders, where such transmission is authorised, unless information pertaining to riders of other teams is publicly available.
Any onboard technology device fitted on a bicycle must:
o Be installed on a system designed for bicycles and not affect the certification of any item of the bicycle;
o Not cause a risk for the safety of any rider and, therefore, be affixed in a manner that ensures it is not susceptible of inadvertently dismounting or is non-removable.
The UCI may grant derogations to any envisaged use of onboard technology which is not authorised by the present article. Derogation requests shall be assessed, inter alia, in consideration of criteria of equal access to equipment, sporting fairness and integrity, and shall also comply with articles 1.3.001 to 1.3.006. Derogations may be limited to specific events and riders or teams.
